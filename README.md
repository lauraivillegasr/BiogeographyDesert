# Hierarchical Patterns of Soil Biodiversity in the Atacama Desert: Insights Across Biological Scales

Here you will find all the code implemented in the analysis of the manuscriot titled "Hierarchical Patterns of Soil Biodiversity in the Atacama Desert: Insights Across Biological Scales". The analysis is divided in two blocks: Ecological estimates and Modeling. 

1. Inside the Ecological Estimates folder you will find the scripts for obtaining jaccard dissimalirity index and perform a mantel test, as well as information on how to generate the haplotype networks to further estimate eucledian distance and nucleotide diversity.

* To run ecological estimates and the different models in R, the following packages are quired on R:

2. In the modeling folder, you will find scripts for modeling using linear models and random forest for both genera richness and reproductive mode estimation. 

* To gather ecological factors for the set of coordinates of each of the sampling spots using python 3, the following are reuiqred:
